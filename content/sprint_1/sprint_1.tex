\section{Sprint Overview}

% Get ready for development (Update tools)
% Get the project to a stable state

The focus of the first sprint, for all project groups across the multi-project, was to stabilize and get an overview of the project. The project was inherited from former 6th semester project groups and not many knew what the \giraf project was about.

\\
Stabilizing the project included setting up development tools and environments. It also included getting the code base to a more stable and useful state, than it was when it was first encountered at the start of this semester, without, from the users perspective, adding new features.
