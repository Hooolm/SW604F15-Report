\section{Android Guidelines}
\todo{DONE-start}
A short list of articles with a few words of advice was written down for the purpose of helping inexperienced Android developers in the multiproject. This guideline was uploaded to the multi project wiki-page and can be seen in \appref{app:android_guidelines}. These guidelines includes guidance in using common Android elements such as the \androidinline{Fragment} and \androidinline{Activiy} classes. These guidelines should increase basic understanding of how the Android operating system works and some pointers to common mistakes and conventions.
