\section{Fragment Constructors}
\label{sec:fragment_constructors}

According to the Android API documentation \parencite{android_dev_fragment}, Android Fragment subclasses must make a public no-argument constructor, i.e. a default constructor, available. However, the \giraf-class \androidinline{SettingsLauncher} (that extends \androidinline{Fragment}) fails to provide such a constructor which causes crashes, when the system tries to recreate the \androidinline{Fragment}. The standard practice when sub classing \androidinline{Fragment} objects is to provide a static factory method, called \androidinline{newInstance}, which creates a new instance of the \androidinline{Fragment} subclass. \todo{Find kilde p√• newInstance} \androidinline{newInstance} takes its arguments and passes them to the created \androidinline{Fragment} subclass object through an Android \androidinline{Bundle} instance.
\\\\
In order to resolve the issue, the \androidinline{newInstance} method and default constructors will be implemented where needed. Other occurrences of the same error might happen elsewhere in the system, and will be handled in the same way when encountered. This will comply with the Android convention for fragments and provide stability to the system.
