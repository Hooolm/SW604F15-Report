\section{Unused Drawer}
\label{sec:unused_drawer}

When we took over the \launcher project, the sidebar contained a drawer that could be opened. During the development it was discovered, by contact with the users, that the drawer was unused and undesired. The fact that the drawer could be opened was indicated by the handle that can be seen in \figref{fig:button_inconsistency}. In order to accommodate for the fact that the drawer is redundant, it was decided to redesign it such that it did not seem clickable. This was achieved by removing the graphical indication of a drawer (see \figref{fig:ugly_and_beautiful_buttons_example_solution}) and removing the \androidinline{onClickListener} on the drawer such that it does not move.
