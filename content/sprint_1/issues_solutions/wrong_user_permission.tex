\section{Wrong User Permissions}
\label{sec:wrong_user_permissions}

In the \giraf-applications, there exists three different profile-types, namely \emph{Administrator}, \emph{Guardian}, and \emph{User}. Administrators have the widest permissions, and are allowed to create guardians and users. Guardians can administrate a subset of the users, for instance the users connected to a specific institution, or part of an institution. Users are allowed to use different applications, namely the ones that have been added to their profile by one of their guardians. 
\\\\
However, these different profile-types are not enforced correctly in the \launcher application. Currently, guardian and user profiles have access to the same features. For instance, a regular user may access the settings-panel and choose which applications that should be accessible for that particular user. This feature should only be available for guardian and administrator profiles.
\\\\
Before a guardian hands the tablet to a user, the guardian needs to switch profile to that specific user, so that the system knows what features should be available. Only guardians should be allowed to switch profiles. Currently all profile types are able to switch profiles, meaning that regular users can switch to a guardian profile and thereby gain access to parts of the application that should otherwise be unavailable.

\subsection{Solutions}
\label{sub:wrong_user_permissions_solutions}

We fixed the problem by adding a simple check to profile-type of the current user. The buttons which allowed for switching profiles and settings would then be disabled if the current user is not a guardian or administrator.
