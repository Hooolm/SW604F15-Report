\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{cha:conclusion}

The goal for the first sprint was to stabilize the \launcher application, make its functions work, and prevent crashes. During this sprint, we have resolved various crashes that were found during manual and automated monkey test. All of these crashes were attempt repaired and we were unable to reproduce them. We found the \launcher to be stable and the \launcher was deemed at an acceptable and usable state at the sprint end evaluation. Further development of the \launcher was therefore not given a high priority. 

There are still several potential developer stories for the \launcher, but they were not found too problematic. A developer story is, in \giraf terminology, a requirement, much like a scrum user story, which originates from the developers and not the users. A developer story could be some issue in the code which requires attention of the developers but would not directly affect the experience of the users much.    

The \launcher was shipped to the project group responsible for Google Play and application deployment was given the task to sign and upload the newest stable version of the \launcher to the Google Play store.
