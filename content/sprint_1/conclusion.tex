\chapter{Sprint Conclusion}
\label{cha:conclusion_sprint_1}

The goal for the first sprint was to stabilize the \launcher application, make its functionality work, prevent crashes, and get familiar with Android and the codebase. During this sprint, we have resolved various crashes that were found during manual and automated monkey test. All of these crashes were attempted to be repaired and we were unable to reproduce them. We found the \launcher to be stable and it was deemed at an acceptable and usable state at the end of the this sprint.

There are still several potential developer stories for the \launcher, but they were not found too problematic. A developer story is, in \giraf terminology, a requirement, much like a Scrum user story, which originates from the developers instead of the users. A developer story could be some issue in the code which requires attention of the developers, but would not directly affect the experience of the users much. \todo{Flyt det her op af til stedet hvor developer stories skal skrives (Charef: Issues and solotions)}

The \launcher was shipped to the project group responsible for Google Play and application deployment. This group was responsible for signing \parencite{android_app_signing} and uploading the newest stable version of the \launcher to the Google Play store.
