\chapter{Sprint Overview}
In the fourth sprint our group asked for a role, dubbed ``Giraf Components Police'', which included the responsibility of \gc and the responsibility to make sure the other groups implemented \gc as they should. We also decided to synthesize a design manual from all our thoughts of the design of \giraf and our attemps to unify the overall design throughout the project in order to pass our design ideas on to the next semesters. The design manual can be found in \appref{app:design_manual}. We were also tasked with further polishing and maintenance of the \ct and the \launcher.
