\section{Deprecation of Old Code}
\label{sec:deprecation_of_old_code}

As part of the further development of \gc we decided to deprecate and eventually remove a lot of old, unused, and unstable classes from the previous semesters. We did this for any component that was easily replaceable by our newly created components, in order to streamline the look of the applications. This is also something we decided to do in order to force the other developers to use our newly developed components, since we found that people were hesitant to change components if it was not strictly necessary. 
\\\\
We started the process by deprecating most of the classes that had been replaced, along with those we found unused. After a while, we notified the other GUI groups via email, that we intended to release a new major version of the \gc library without these deprecated classes in a near future. A few days later we did as promised - deleted the classes and shipped the new version.
