\section{Deprecation of old code}
\label{sec:deprecation_of_old_code}

As part of the further development of \gc we decided to deprecate and eventually remove a lot of old, unsuded, and unstable classes from the previous semesters. We deprecated most of the classes that had been replaced along with those we found unused and notified, via email, the other GUI groups that we intended to release a new major version without these deprecated classes in a near future.
