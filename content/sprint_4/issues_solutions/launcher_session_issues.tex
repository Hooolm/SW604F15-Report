\section{Launcher session}
\label{sec:launcher_session_issues}

The launcher had a problem with its user sessions. It was impossible to login with a guardian profile again once a citizen profile had logged in.  

\subsection{Issue}

The problem was that the old \androidinline{HomeActivity}, from the previous session, was reused by the Android system when the user had logged out and started a new session with a new login.

\subsection{Solution}

Force the system to create a new \androidinline{HomeActivity} for new session by applying a flag to the \androidinline{Intent} used to start the new \androidinline{HomeActivity}. We also added a flag to all activities in the \launcher that ensures that only one instance of the different activities can be active at any one time.
