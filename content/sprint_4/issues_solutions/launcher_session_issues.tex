\section{Launcher Sessions}
\label{sec:launcher_session_issues}

The \launcher had a problem with its user sessions, where it was impossible to login with a guardian profile, once a citizen profile had logged in. The only way of logging back into a guardian account was to terminate and restart the application.
\\\\
The problem was caused by the fact that the \androidinline{HomeActivity} from the previous session was reused by the Android system, when the user had logged out and started a new session with a new login.
\\\\
The solution is to force the system to create a new \androidinline{HomeActivity} for any new session, by applying a flag to the \androidinline{Intent} used to start the new \androidinline{HomeActivity}. At the same time, we also added a flag to all activities in the \launcher that ensures that only one instance of the different activities can be active at any one time.
