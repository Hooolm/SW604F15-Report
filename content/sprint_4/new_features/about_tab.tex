\section{About page}
\label{sec:about_page}

We have implemented an about page, with a simple layout, in the \launcher settings in order to properly give credit to the open source projects used in the \launcher, and thereby in the entire \giraf application suite because of the shared service provide in the \launcher. This was requested by group SW610F15 (The database subproject product owner).
