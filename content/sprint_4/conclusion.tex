\chapter{Sprint Conclusion}
\label{cha:conclusion_sprint_4}

The fourth sprint concluded with a presentation to the customers. The two applications we had been working on, along with the other groups applications, were presented to the customers on a big screen and the customers seemed satisfied with the development. \\

The design manual was completed to a level which describes the design decisions we have made this semester in our effort to streamline \giraf. The design manual includes the design decisions that we found most important, but we have left some open problems, where we had not yet found satisfying solutions for future \giraf developers to pursue. We encourage future \giraf developers to continue the development of this design manual on the \giraf Git server. \\

In order to help them, we have also been actively pursuing groups that did not conform to our design guidelines and did not use the new \gc, as a part of the ``Giraf Components Police'' responsibility. We also provided support and updated the \gc as more people began to use them and thereby found shortcomings and bugs.
