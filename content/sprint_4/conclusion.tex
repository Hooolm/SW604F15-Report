\chapter{Sprint Conclusion}
\label{cha:conclusion_sprint_4}

The fourth sprint concluded with a presentation to the customers. The two applications we had been working on, along with the other groups' applications, were presented to the customers on a big screen and the customers seemed satisfied with the development. \todo{indsæt billede af niklas ved storskærm fyrafyraf}

The design manual was completed to a level which describes the design decisions that have been made throughout this semester. This was done in the effort to streamline the \giraf software suite. The design manual includes the design decisions that we found most important, but we have left some open problems, where we had not yet found satisfying solutions, for future \giraf developers to pursue. We encourage future \giraf developers to continue the development of this design manual on the \giraf Git server.
\\\\
In order to assist other groups, we have been actively pursuing them to confront them about not conforming to our design manual and not using the new \gc, as a part of the ``\giraf Police'' responsibility. We also provided support and updated the \gc as more people began to use them and thereby found shortcomings and bugs.
