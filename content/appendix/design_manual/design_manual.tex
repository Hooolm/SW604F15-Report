\chapter{Design Manual}\label{app:design_manual}

This is the latest iteration of the \giraf Design Manual originally started by group SW606F15 whom aggregated information from previous semester group reports and started with the manual. Their manual was available as a Google Drive document, and it was therefore hard to keep updated while being somewhat inaccessible, since the rest of the project is found in Git repositories. \\

The current iteration is a complete rewrite by our group with added sections about \gc, layouts, styles, colors, and other recommended practices. This document can also be found on the project's joint Git server, and might therefore be included in other projects as well. That being said, we, group SW604F15, are the original creators of the document.
