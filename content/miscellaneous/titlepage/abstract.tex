\giraf Autism Application Suite is an Android Application suite which helps people diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) with different aspects of their every day lives. Many of ideas and principles used in \giraf are already used in different institutions that takes care of people diagnosed with ASD.

The focus throughout this semester has been to unify and stabilize the different \giraf Android Applications. This included resolving bugs and trying to make all the applications appear and work as a single package. The overall goal was to make to applications stable enough to be used in their intended environment.   
%\\\\
We have contributed to the project with an improved and stabilized version of the \giraf \launcher application and a complete rework of the existing \giraf \ct. Our, perhaps, greatest contribution has been new and reworked components in the \gc library to help streamlining the different applications.    
%\\\\
From the usability evaluations, conducted by others, we have found that our contributions were accepted by the customers. A series of unstructured pseudo random touch event input tests (Monkey Tests) have shown our applications to be resilient and stable.
