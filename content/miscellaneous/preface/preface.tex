\chapter*{Preface}

This report is developed by project group SW604F15 from the Software programme at Aalborg University as part of the sixth semester project from Februrary 2015 to August 2015. This project is concerned with the continued development of a software suit for Android tablets that should assist citizens diagnosed with an \emph{Autism Spectrum Disorder}. This software suite is based on previous semesters development, and has been continously developed by the group along side the rest of the students on this semester.
\\\\
During the project period, the study method \emph{Problem-based learning}, also known as \emph{The AAU model} on Aalborg University has been utilized. However this report is not structured like an ordinary report from the computer science department of Aalborg University. This report focuses on describing the process of developing on mature code base and working intertwined with the more than 50 people in a software development context. Furthermore the report will also contain information useful for future project groups whom needs to continue on the work, this part will be more precise than a regular \emph{Further work} section.
