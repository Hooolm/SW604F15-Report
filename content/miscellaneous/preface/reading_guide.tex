\section*{Reading Guide}
The report is splint into four parts, one part for each sprint in development process, and have been written in chronological order regarding this process. 

\subsection*{Translations}
\label{sub:translations}
Since the report is written in English and the GUI of the project is Danish, some words might be written in Danish when reading. If any element is written in Danish, we will provide an English translation for convenience, for instance \translated{Klik for at vælge indstillinger for hjemmeskærmen}{Click to choose settings for the home screen}. These translations are not documented anywhere other than in this report.
