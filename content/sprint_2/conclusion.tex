The functionality of selecting a pictogram in a category has been implemented, but the visual cue that tells the user which pictogram is selected (as can be seen on the ``Leget\o j'' category in \figrefpage{fig:ct_category_view}) has not currently been implemented. Furthermore, the possibility of removing a selected pictogram from category by clicking the Trashcan-icon in the contextual menu at the bottom has also been implemented. Since the \ct-project is not done yet, work on the project will have to be continued.
\\\\
The design, complete with mock-ups, and most of the implementation of the graphical user interface of the \ct was completed. Some of the functionality of \ct and some communication with the database was not yet completed. The \ct is ready for implementation of its remaining functionality. The \gc-library was extended with \androidinline{GirafActivity}, a standardized action bar, and various dialogs.
