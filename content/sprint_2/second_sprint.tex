The focus of the second sprint was to complete and stabilize the applications with the highest assigned priority, the priorities are listed in \tabref{tab:application_priorities_sprint_two}, which was determined by the customers. The costumers were asked to prioritize the list of existing applications, with 0 being the highest priority, during the sprint end of the first sprint. Application responsibilities were then divided among the GUI-groups.
