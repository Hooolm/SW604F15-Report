\chapter{Sprint Overview}
\label{sec:sprint2_overview}
The focus of the second sprint was to complete and stabilize the applications with the highest assigned priority, the priorities are listed in \tabref{tab:application_priorities_sprint_two}, which was determined by the customers. The costumers were asked to prioritize the list of existing applications, with 0 being the highest priority, during the Sprint Planning Meeting for the second sprint. Application responsibilities were then divided among the GUI-groups. Please note that these different priorities do not reflect which applications the customers wants us to focus on, but rather which applications are important for them. So for instance, if an application has a high priority, but is almost ``done'' then it would require less man hours. Some applications does not have a priority because the customers could not relate to these.
