\section{SCRUM in \giraf}
% Diskuter hvorfor SCRUM måske på nogle måder ikke giver mening i context af giraf pga vidensdeling mellem semestre

Towards the end of the project we got to reflect a little on the \giraf development method. We found the that the overall agile approach, without much documentation besides the reports, used by most groups this semester might cause some trouble because of the lack of written documentation to support knowledge transfer between semesters. One might say that the semester reports provide such documentation but really the reports are too scattered across the different semesters and the different projects to be useful. Old semester reports might also include information that is no longer relevant to the next semesters. The transition process between semester could possibly run much smoother if every subproject had its own documentation, to support knowledge transfer, which would be further iteratively developed each semester. The agile SCRUM approach during this semester worked well but we suggest future semester groups to consider adding the further iterative development of such a written documentation as a work product towards the end of their semester to properly support knowledge transfer between semesters.
