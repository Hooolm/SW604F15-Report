\chapter{Reflection}
\label{cha:reflection}

During the \giraf project, our group has experienced how it is to work together with more than 50 other developers, and how working on a large five-year-old codebase can be like. During the development we found some issues and key points one could consider before engaging in a large complex collaboration like this. This chapter contains some reflections on the process and on the overall project.
