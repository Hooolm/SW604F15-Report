\chapter{Reflection}
\label{cha:reflection}

During this project of \giraf our group have experienced how it is to work together with more than 50 other developers, with a large five-year-old codebase. During the development we found some issues and key points one could consider before engaging in a large complex collaboration like this. This chapter contains some reflections on the process and to the overall project.
