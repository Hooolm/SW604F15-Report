\section{Issues and Solutions}

We conducted a series of unstructured tests and UI/Application Exerciser Monkey (Monkey) \todo{http://developer.android.com/tools/help/monkey.html} tests in order to explore the launcher and find bugs during the start of the first sprint. These identified bugs were then written in 


Monkey is a tool, which comes with the Android Debug Bridge (adb) \todo{http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html}, used to perform series of pseudo-random streams of user events to test the application UI under stress.

We found the Monkey tool to be useful and indeed it did help us find a few concurrency issues when switching between tabs in the settings activity of the launcher.
