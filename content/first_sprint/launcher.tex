\section{Launcher}

This group opted for and got assigned to improve the \giraf-Launcher application during a meeting between representatives of the GUI project area groups.
The \giraf-Launcher is specialized Android launcher applikation which can be used to populate an android devices' home screen. Most Android devices come bundled with a default launcher for their homescreen and most users never think to replace it. An Android Launcher is the main entry point, for users, to the graphical user interface for android. Android Launchers are used to make other installed apps available to the user, usually through a grid of applikation icons, and to present Android App Widgets. The intended purpose of the \giraf-Launcher, besides the functionality of a regular launcher, is to give the user a single entrance to the \giraf software suite and to give the illusion of using the \giraf-system and not Android.
