\section{Sprint Overview}
The focus of the first sprint, for all project groups across the multi-project, was to stabilize and get an overview of the project. The project was inherited from former 6th semester project groups and not many knew what the \giraf project was about.
\\
Stabilizing the project included setting up development tools and environments. It also included getting the code base to a more stable and useful state, from the users perspective. This new state of the system should however not include any new features.
