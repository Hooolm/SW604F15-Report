\section{Enforce Design Guide In Settings}
\label{sec:enforce_design_guide_in_settings}

The graphical design of the GUI was found to be very inconsistent in general around in the \giraf-software suite. This issue was discovered by the \emph{SW606F15}, that is the group responsible for user requirements and the graphical design guide of the project.
\\\\
In cooperation with this group it was found that the implementations of the GUI-components that existed needed refactoring based on the code quality and structure of the existing code base of GUI-components.

\subsection{Button Inconsistency}
\label{sub:button_inconsistency}
One of the problem found by \emph{SW606F15} is illustrated in figure \figref{fig:button_inconsistency} where it can be seen that the settings button (top most button) and the logout button (lower most button) is very inconsistent in the graphical design. 

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

    \caption{Example of inconsistent Buttons}
    \label{fig:button_inconsistency}
\end{figure}

This motivated \emph{SW606F15}, to create a graphical design document which enforces a standard for the GUI \todo{Maybe insert the design document in the appendix and refer to it}. Further more this design flaw was found in the GUI of the launcher which made us commit to the job of solving this problem.
\\\\
Firstly the design of the buttons was created with various colors to symbolize different groups of actions. As seen on \figref{???} the settings button is teal symbolizing utility where as the brown color symbolizes actions on profiles (logging out, changing user).

After this design was implemented so that each button had an icon and a base-color that covered all types of button that was necessary in the \giraf software-suite. However it was found that the customers did not like these colored buttons and wanted them to appear more neutral but with colored icons instead. This was firstly corrected in the design document created by \emph{SW606F15} and them we implemented it. These button can be seen on \figref{???}
