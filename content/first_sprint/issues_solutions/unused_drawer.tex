\section{Unused Drawer}
\label{sec:unused_drawer}

During the development it was discovered by request of the users that the drawer of the sidebar in the \launcher was unused and not wanted anymore. In the initial version of this project the sidebar contained a drawer (open by the handle as seen in \figref{fig:button_inconsistency}). This problem was simply solved by removing the graphical indication of a drawer (see \figref{fig:ugly_and_beautiful_buttons_example_solution}) and removing the \androidinline{onClickListener} on the drawer.
