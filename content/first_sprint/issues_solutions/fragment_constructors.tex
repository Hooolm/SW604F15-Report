\section{Fragment Constructors}
\label{sec:fragment_constructors}

According to the Android API documentation \parencite{android_dev_fragment} Android Fragment subclasses must make a public no-argument constructor, i.e. a default constructor, available. However the \giraf-class \androidinline{SettingsLauncher} fails to provide such a default constructor which causes crashes. The standard practice when sub classing \androidinline{Fragment} objects is to provide a static factory method, which creates a new instance of the \androidinline{Fragment} subclass, called \androidinline{newInstance}. \androidinline{newInstance} takes its arguments and passes them to the created \androidinline{Fragment} subclass object through an Android \androidinline{Bundle} instance. 

\subsection{Solution} 
\label{sub:fragment_constructors_solution}
In order to resolve the issue, the newInstance method and default constructors will be implemented where needed. Other occurrences of the same error might happen elsewhere in the system, and will be handled in the same way when encountered. This will enforce the android API documentation, and provide stability to the system.
