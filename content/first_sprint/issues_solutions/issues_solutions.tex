\chapter{Issues and Solutions}

We conducted a series of unstructured tests and UI/Application Exerciser Monkey (Monkey) \parencite{android_monkey} tests in order to explore the launcher and find bugs during the start of the first sprint. Monkey is a tool, which comes with the Android Debug Bridge (adb) \parencite{android_adb}, used to perform series of pseudo-random streams of user events to test the application UI under stress. We found the Monkey tool to be useful and it did help us find several issues in the code, e.g. concurrency issues when switching between tabs in the settings activity of the launcher.

Android and general code mistakes might occur multiple times in code base, and will be corrected when discovered, but only the first discovered occurrence is mentioned in this chapter.
