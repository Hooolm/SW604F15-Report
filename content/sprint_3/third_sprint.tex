\chapter{Sprint Overview}
In the third sprint our group have hand over the task of creating and maintaining the shared GUI components (GirafComponents) of this project. This transfer of responsibility have been done in order for our group to finish up the \ct. The workload of both the \ct and the GirafComponents was too much for our group to guarantee that we could complete both tasks. The focus of this sprint is therefore to finish up the \ct and ensure that it works stable after this sprint.
