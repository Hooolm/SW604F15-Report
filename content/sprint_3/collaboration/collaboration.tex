\chapter{Collaboration}

The following collaboration sections are the shared work of ours and another group. We sat down together and resolved shared, or similar, issues across the projects. The documented cases are far from the only collaborations we have participated in during the development of \giraf, but they are, however, the only collaborations that have been documented in detail. While collaborating with other groups, we used engineering practices like pair programming and code reviews. The collaborative work that we have conducted with these other groups is described in this chapter.
