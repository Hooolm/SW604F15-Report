\chapter{Collaboration}
Throughout the third sprint we collaborated with different groups. 

\todo{DONEHOLMIUM: Skriv motivation for de to samarbejder med grupperne og kort hvad det gik ud på. Skriv også at der har været en del samarbejde generelt men en masse små ting. Vi har udvalgt de opgaver hvor der var mest pair programming involveret.}

These collaboration is the shared work of our and another group. We sat down together and resolved a shared or similar issue across the projects. During the development of \giraf this is far from the only collaboration with other groups, however this are the only well documented sessions where we used methods like pair programming and code reviews. This chapter will describe the official collaborations that we have done with the other groups.
