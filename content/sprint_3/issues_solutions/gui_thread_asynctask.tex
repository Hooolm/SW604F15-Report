\section{Android GUI Thread}
\label{sec:gui_thread_async_task}

One of our focuses throughout the design and implementation of the \launcher, the \ct, and the \gc has been to keep the GUI thread of the Android applications free from heavy load to keep the applications smooth and responsive. We have described in detail how this has been achieved in appendix \appref{design_manual} under ``Long tasks''.
