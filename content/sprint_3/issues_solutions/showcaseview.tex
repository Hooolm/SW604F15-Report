\section{Help Functionality using ShowcaseView Library}
\label{sec:help_functionality_using_showcaseview_library}

\todo{Mention google uses this}.

It was our initial intention, as described in \secref{sec:home_screen} and seen in \figref{fig:improved_design_launch_screen} and \figref{fig:improved_design_category_selected_1}, to have some arrows with accompanying text to help guide the users with their first use of the application. We were unable to find a library which implemented such an arrow overlay, but we did however find another library called \androidinline{ShowcaseView}. \androidinline{ShowcaseView} is the name of a class and a library licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 \parencite{apache2license}, originally created by Alex Curran and hosted on GitHub \parencite{showcaseview_by_alex_curran}. \androidinline{ShowcaseView} is a subclass of \androidinline{View} which, in combination with the rest of the library, can be used to showcase one or more areas of the screen. An area is showcased by putting a dark transparent overlay over the screen and then letting the showcased area, in a circle, be completely transparent along with accompanying text as seen in \figref{fig:showcaseview_example}. Showcasing will be active through the first visit of the application and later on demand by clicking a help button.

\subsection{Additions to Library}

% NOTICE !!!!!! ------------> Changes here should also be made in the NOTICE file <------------
The interface \androidinline{Target}, have been changed to an abstract class. And subclasses of \androidinline{Target}, i.e. classes that previously implemented the interface \androidinline{Target}, has been modified with additional constructors, methods and properties to allow them to store their radius and a \androidinline{scaleMultiplier} (this was previously hard coded). The \androidinline{ViewTarget} subclass, of \androidinline{Target}, has been further modified to calculate its own radius based on its target view. The \androidinline{ShowcaseView} class and supporting classes have been modified to allow manual positioning of the help text for the \androidinline{ShowcaseView}.
\\\\
The \androidinline{TextDrawer} class has been modified to fix a problem with negative widths of the drawing area.
The additions to the library code is also described in a \mono{NOTICE.txt} file which is distributed with the code in the library's root directory.
\\\\
A new class \androidinline{ShowcaseManager} was introduced to help the transitions between different showcases. The class internally maintains a queue of objects implementing a \androidinline{Showcase} interface. A \androidinline{ShowcaseManager} instance will, when started with a call to its method \androidinline{start}, fetch the first \androidinline{Showcase} from its queue and call its \androidinline{configShowCaseView} method. This \androidinline{configShowCaseView} method then configures the \androidinline{ShowcaseView} to match the first showcase by setting a subclass of \androidinline{Target}. The \androidinline{ShowcaseView} includes a next button which will, when clicked, invoke the next step by further dequeuing elements and thereby configure the next showcase. When the showcase queue is empty the dark overlay disappears and the application can then be used normally.
