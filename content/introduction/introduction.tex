This report focuses on assisting people diagnosed with autism \todo{Insert some more medicinal description}. The report is written in correlation with the development of an existing \emph{Android}-software suite for tablets called \giraf(Graphical Interface Resources for Autistic Folk), containing tools and games to assist and improve daily aspects of people with this disorder. The motivation for this tool is to digitize some of the existing tools that people with an autism disorder, already uses. One of the main stakeholder of the \giraf-system is a kindergarten for children with autism. In this kindergarten the staff uses a lot of time preparing various visual schemes and plans for the children for them to be better to understand basic social strategies. This could be for instance be a scheme of the day for a child, constructed of pictures laminated and applied velcro-tape on the wall for the children to learn from.
