% Purpose of software
This report focuses on the continued development of an existing \emph{Android}-software suite for tablets called \giraf (Graphical Interface Resources for Autistic Folk), which includes tools and games to assist and train everyday aspects of life for citizens diagnosed an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) \parencite{asd}. The tool is currently in development but should, when finished, be used as an digital alternative to the already existing tools and techniques used \parencite{birken_slides}.
\\\\ 
\todo{DONE-start (Skriv omkring admins)}This system has three types of users, the citizens diagnosed with ASD and the institutional or legal guardians of these citizens. The last type of users is the administrators. Using \giraf, a citizen can find tools to mimic and learn social patterns\todo{Mention how the application help citizens with spoken language}. The guardians customize the various application such that they are optimized for the needs of the individual citizens. The administrators is someone who is allowed to manipulate with users and profiles in the system. This roles does not use the tools, but ensures that the citizens and guardians can use it, and that their devices are correctly configured for it. \todo{DONE-end}
\\\\
The primary customer of \giraf is the municipality of Aalborg, where one of the main stakeholders of the \giraf-system is a kindergarten called \emph{Birken}. This kindergarten takes care of children diagnosed with ASD. The staff in \emph{Birken} spend a lot of time preparing physical and visual weekly schedules and checklists based on laminated printouts for the children which helps with their daily functions. This has motivated some of the previous developers of the \giraf project to try to digitize the schedule and checklists currently used \parencite{birken_slides}.
