% Purpose of software
This report focuses on the continued development of an existing \emph{Android}-software suite for tablets called \giraf(Graphical Interface Resources for Autistic Folk), which includes tools and games to assist and train everyday aspects of life for citizens diagnosed an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and their gaurdians. 

The motivation for this tool is to digitize some of the existing tools that people with an autism disorder, already uses. 

One of the main stakeholder of the \giraf-system is a kindergarten called \emph{Birken} for children with autism. In this kindergarten the staff uses a lot of time preparing various visual schemes and plans for the children for them to be better to understand basic social strategies. 

This could be for instance be a schedule of the day for a child, constructed of pictures laminated and applied velcro-tape on the wall for the children to learn from.
