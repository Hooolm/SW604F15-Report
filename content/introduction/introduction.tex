Technology can enhance the quality of our lives in many different ways. A new airbag technology in our cars or an intelligent thermostat in our house. New technology helps us on many different aspects. These technologies also includes software, that enables devices to assist people in new and innovative ways.
\\\\
% Purpose of software
This report focuses on the continued development of an existing \emph{Android}-software suite for tablets called \giraf (Graphical Interface Resources for Autistic Folk), which includes tools and games to assist and train everyday aspects of life for citizens diagnosed an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) \parencite{asd} and their guardians. The tool is currently in development but should, when finished, be used as an digital alternative to the already existing tools and techniques used. \todo{Insert reference to the kindergarten or some other application of the tools}
\\\\
This system has three types of users, the citizens diagnosed with ASD and the institutional guardians of these citizens. Furthermore the last type of users is the administrators. How ever the customer of \giraf is the municipality of Aalborg.
\todo[inline]{Describe the user types and give some user stories maybe}
One of the main stakeholder of the \giraf-system is a kindergarten called \emph{Birken}. This kindergarten takes care of children diagnosed with an ASD. The staff in \emph{Birken} spends a lot of time preparing visual weekly schedules and checklists for the children which helps with their daily functions. This has motivated some of the previous developers of the \giraf project to try to digitize the schedule (\emph{Ugeplan}) and checklists (\emph{Sekvens}). \todo{This would be a great place to talk a bit more about other stakeholders or interests and maybe explain a bit more about the program}
