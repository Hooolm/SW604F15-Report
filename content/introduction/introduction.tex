\todo[inline]{Insert mild intro. Techonology helps our lives get better -> Folk with autism can be helped}

% Purpose of software
This report focuses on the continued development of an existing \emph{Android}-software suite for tablets called \giraf (Graphical Interface Resources for Autistic Folk), which includes tools and games to assist and train everyday aspects of life for citizens diagnosed an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and their guardians. The tool is currently in development but should, when finished, be used as an digital alternative to the already existing tools and techniques used. \todo{Insert reference to the kindergarten or some other application of the tools}
\\\\
One of the main stakeholder of the \giraf-system is a kindergarten called \emph{Birken}. This kindergarten takes care of children diagnosed with an ASD. The staff in \emph{Birken} spends a lot of time preparing visual weekly schedules and checklists for the children which helps with their daily functions. This has motivated some of the previous developers of the \giraf project to try to digitize the schedule (\emph{Ugeplan}) and checklists (\emph{Sekvens}). \todo{This would be a great place to talk a bit more about other stakeholders or interests and maybe explain a bit more about the program}
\\\\
% For them to be better to understand basic social strategies. 
% This could be for instance be a schedule for the day for a child, constructed of pictograms, simple pictures, laminated and applied to different surfaces using Velcro-tape for the children to inspect.
