New technology helps us on many different aspects. These technologies also includes software, that enables devices to assist people in new and innovative ways.

% Purpose of software
This report focuses on the continued development of an existing \emph{Android}-software suite for tablets called \giraf (Graphical Interface Resources for Autistic Folk), which includes tools and games to assist and train everyday aspects of life for citizens diagnosed an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) \parencite{asd} and their guardians. The tool is currently in development but should, when finished, be used as an digital alternative to the already existing tools and techniques used \parencite{touch_autism}.
\\\\
This system has three types of users, the citizens diagnosed with ASD and the institutional or legal guardians of these citizens. Furthermore the last type of users is the administrators. Using \giraf a citizen finds tools to understand and learn social patterns. The guardians customizes the various application such that they are optimized for the needs of the different citizens. And lastly the administrator that have ensures that the users have the correct setup before and while using the software suite. 
\\\\
The primary customer of \giraf is the municipality of Aalborg, where one of the main stakeholders of the \giraf-system is a kindergarten called \emph{Birken}. This kindergarten takes care of children diagnosed with an ASD. The staff in \emph{Birken} spends a lot of time preparing physical and visual weekly schedules and checklists based on laminated printouts for the children which helps with their daily functions. This has motivated some of the previous developers of the \giraf project to try to digitize the schedule (\emph{Ugeplan}) and checklists (\emph{Sekvens}). \todo{This would be a great place to talk a bit more about other stakeholders or interests and maybe explain a bit more about the program}
