\section{Category Tool and Components}

This group did not really have any project preferences for this sprint, since we already brought the \launcher to a stable state, during the sprint planning. The \giraf \ct was given a high priority at the sprint end of the first sprint and we got assigned to this project since we did not have any preferences. 

The \giraf \ct is an application which is used by guardians to create and manage pictogram categories. These categories are used across many different applications including the category game known as Train.

The status of the \ct, as inherited, was that it was not even able to compile due to the changes of the submodules structure across the project during first sprint. We were also assigned to construct a series of standard components for the \mono{GIRAF\_COMPONENTS} library. These standard components should, as of the start of the second sprint, include: A specialization of the Android \androidinline{ActionBar} for \giraf, scalable text buttons, and a standard dialog-box to use across all applications.
