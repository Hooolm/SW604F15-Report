\section{Category Tool and Components}

This group did not really have any subproject preferences for this sprint, since we allready brought the \launcher to a stable state, during the sprint planning. The \giraf Category Tool was given a high priority at the sprint end of the first sprint and we got assigned to this subproject since we did not have any preferences. The status of the category tool, as inherited, was that it was not even able to compile due to the changes of the submodules structure across the project. We were also assigned to construct a series of standard components for the ``GIRAF\_COMPONENTS'' library. These standard components should include: A specialisation of the Android \androidinline{ActionBar} for \giraf, scalable text buttons, and a standard dialog-box for use across all applications.
